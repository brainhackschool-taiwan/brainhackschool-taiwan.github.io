# Introduction to git and github - Exercise

## Description:

- **Please bear in mind that this Introduction to git and github module is MANDATORY, so you are required to submit an assignment following the guidelines laid out below**.
- Most of this exercise is identical to that of [BrainHack School 2022](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/git_github/). The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that you've become familiarized with basic git commands and putting projects on git control, which will come in handy when you're working on your own projects!

## Instructions:

- On the GitHub page, create a public repository named `<your_name>_project` (e.g., `Amanda_Lin_project`), and initialize it with a `README` and `LICENSE` file.
- If you have CLI installed, you can now clone the repository to your local computer and create an issue remotely in your terminal with `gh issue create --title "your title" --body "content"`. If not, stay on the GitHub page and create an issue.
- Clone your GitHub repository to your local computer, then create a branch named `iss1`.
- In the terminal, add a short bio to the README, which should include an image of your GitHub profile picture. Hint: You can adapt this code snippet, but please note that certain lines need changing, e.g., the username, obviously!

```
- In your terminal, commit and push the changes you've made.
- On the GitHub page, open a pull request for your changes, titled `iss1 - add bio`.
- On the GitHub page, invite `amandalin047` as a collaborator on your repo.
- **Please DO NOT CLOSE YOUR TERMINAL just yet!!** Please head to the next section for assignment submission guidelines.

## Assignment Submission:

- Well, you should have quite a bit of commands in your terminal by this point. Please copy and paste EVERYTHING in the terminal — starting from the very first line when you began doing this exercise and including the outputs — to a text file `<your_name>.txt`. Don't worry if you got some errors in your terminal; the TAs will fish out the working commands.
- Send an email with the subject title `[bshtw] <Your_Student_ID> Introduction to git and github` (e.g., `[bshtw] B05202021 Introduction to git and github`) to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com, where the student ID should have all English letters capitalized, and the module name should be precisely the same as the example, with only the first letter of the first word capitalized. The aforementioned `<your_name>.txt` file should be attached to your email.
- You will receive an email reply titled `Receipt of submission` about 30 minutes after your submission email has been sent. This email will notify you whether your files have been successfully uploaded.
- Please contact `Amanda Lin #5919` or `Ki #1892` on Discord if your submission email keeps failing.

## Grading:

- Your assignment will be graded on a three-point scale: 0, 0.5, 1. 
- If the commands and outputs in your text file worked successfully and you've done all the steps listed in Instructions, a full mark of 1 will be given (again, don't worry about the errors in the terminal). If you missed some steps or it seems some of your commands/outputs aren't quite right, one of the TAs will contact you on Discord and walk you through the exercise. A full mark of 1 will also be given as long as you complete the exercise in the end. If, however, we fail to contact you, a partial credit mark of 0.5 will be given. In the case where we don't receive an email from you or you send us a blank one and go MIA (missing in action)... Sorry, that's a 0!
