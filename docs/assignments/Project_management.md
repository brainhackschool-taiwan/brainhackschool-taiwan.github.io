# Project Management - Exercise

## Description:

- This exercise is a copy from [Brainkhack School](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/project_management/), with small adaptations and changes in the recipient.
- This exercise is basically identical to that of [BrainHack School 2022](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/project_management/).
- There are two parts to this assignment. While the first part is mandatory for you to get your credits, the second part is optional.

## Instructions:
### Part 1: Your understanding of project management
- Watch the [video presentation by Elazabeth DuPre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBMc8bgSK6o) and go over the slides.
- Fill up this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/umip1TtDfvXnx1qn8) to submit your answers to part 1. You may download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sOAB81thB5e5Y2vfCPwcfgnX3L6lpcju/view?usp=share_link) to prepare your answers somewhere else ahead.

### Part 2: Create a project template for your BrainHack School project (Optional)
- Follow the instructions in the [module](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/project_management/).

## Submission:
- Follow up with Chih-Chia Hsing through the following methods:
 1. Send an email to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com with the subject title `[BHSTW] <Your_Student_ID> Project Management` (e.g., `[BHSTW] R08454015 Project Management`)
   - If you only completed part 1, just write in the email that you have completed the Google form.
   - If you choose to also complete part 2, make sure to also include a text file to your answers for part 2 and a link to your Github repository in the email.
 2. Alternatively, you can also message `@Jess CC Hsing #8707` on Discord directly. It might take some time for me to respond though.
- Attempts: no limits. Multiple attempts are allowed until you are satisfied with your score.
- Points: 0 (fail) / 1 (pass)
