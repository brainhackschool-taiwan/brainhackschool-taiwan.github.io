# The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) ecosystem - Exercise

## Description:

- This exercise is a copy from [Brainkhack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/bids/), with small adaptations and changes in the recipient.

## Instructions:

- Download [this file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCrCgAdhBSEbKVkUGFNEKoIiSV0-Wg0V/view?usp=share_link) which contains instructions to the module exercise.
- Answer the two questions in the document by filling in your response in the document.
- Open up a Jypyter notebook and follow along the instructions in the markdown file. A successful attempt should contain both the `list of the flip angles in DS000228 using pybids` and `a pandas dataframe using pybids generated from the Midnight Brain Scan dataset` in different cells.

## Submission:
- Upload your Jupyter notebook onto Google Colab. Name your file as `The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) ecosystem`. Click `Share` at the top right of the window and add `brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com` as an editor and copy the link.
- Send an email to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com with the subject title `[BHSTW] <Your_Student_ID> The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) ecosystem` (e.g., `[BHSTW] R08454015 The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) ecosystem`).  Make sure that the email contains:
 1. The link to the Google Colab notebook in the body.
 2. The markdown file with the two questions answered.
- Attempts: no limits. Multiple attempts are allowed until you are satisfied with your score.
