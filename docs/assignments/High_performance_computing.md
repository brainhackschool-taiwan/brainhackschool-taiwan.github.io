# High performance computing - Exercise

## Description:

- High performance computing is important for advanced neuroimaging analysis, but we don’t recommend you to watch the video. Taiwan currently don't have free high performance computing service for academia, and and those service is not designed for neuroimaging analysis. Furthermore, the hands-on tutorial in this video in not accessible outside the Canadian campus. If you are a very beginner for neuroimaging analysis and scientific researches, you will encounter great difficulty to understand the material. 
- For those who have background for computing and want to earn the point for this module, please follow the instruction and submit your assignment.

## Instructions:

- Again, please note that the hands-on tutorial in this module is not accessible in Taiwan. We don’t recommend to complete this module for beginners. If you’re very interesting on high-performance computing, you can still grasp a concept of high performance computing in this module.
- Go to the [module page](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/hpc/) and watch the video.
- Copy and paste the following question in a text file (`*.txt`, `*.md`) or Mircosoft Word (`*.docx`). 

```
1. (0.2 points) What you can do for high-performance computing?
	a. Supercomputers/clusters will always dramatically run faster than your laptop.
	b. You have permission to directly install the software that is needed for your analysis.
	c. You can execute analysis job that have intensive but reasonable usage of computing resources.
	d. Supercomputers/clusters will execute my analysis job whenever I ask them to do.

Your answer:

---
2. (0.2 points) What is the best way to execute your analysis job on supercomputer?
	a. Remote connect to virtual desktop on supercomputer. Open the software you needed with graphical interface, and then execute the job by click the button.
	b. Write an e-mail and attach your files to the staffs who is responsible for the cluster computing.
	c. Upload your files, and then open the IDE (RStudio, Jupyter notebook, VScode) on supercomputer and run the files.
	d. Compile your analysis code to bash script and submit to slurm.

Your answer:

---
3. (0.2 points) Which command is important to access the required software for your job when you submit job to a supercomputer?
	a. module
	b. import
	c. library
	d. load

Your answer:

---
4. (0.2 points) To run the analysis scripts on supercomputer, it is very important to know what is the computing resource you need. Please list at least three computing resources that is require to specify when you submit your job.

Your answer:

---
5. (0.2 points) Slurm is a cluster management system for high performance computing. The tutorial video demonstrated the following command for slurm, please briefly explain the function for each command below:

Your answer:
	sbatch:
	squeue:
	scancel:
	sacct:

```

- Write you answer to each questions and save the file. Follow the below steps to submit your files 

## Submission:

- You should have a text file (`*.txt`, `*.md`) or Mircosoft Word (`*.docx`).
- Please send an email to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com with the subject title `[bshtw] <Your_Student_ID> Data visualization` (e.g., `[bshtw] B05202021 High performance computing`) 
- Attempts: no limits. You can submit again if you don't stastify your scores.
- Points: 0-1 points.
