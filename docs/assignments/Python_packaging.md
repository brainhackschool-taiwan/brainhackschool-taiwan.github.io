# Python packaging - Exercise

## Description:

- The design of this exercise is to help you package a module that your final project can be built around.
- Please refer to [BrainHack School 2022](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/packaging/), [PyPA](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/), and [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm) for more information about how to package Python modules.

## Instructions:

- Since, by this point, you should have a much clearer outline of your final project, we sincerely hope that the module you're packaging can a basis for starting your final project, rather than a mere "toy" module.
- As there are several ways to package a Python module, you're at liberty to choose however you wish to package yours, as long as it's pip-installable and the module, after being imported, is really executable. **However, you should briefly describe in a `README.md` file what this module does or what sorts of functions it has**.
- After you're done packaging, please `pip install <your_module>`
- Open a Jupyter notebook and `import <your_module>`. Write some code that can clearly demonstrate the functions in your module.

## Assignment Submission:

- Upload your packaging folder onto Google Drive and your Jupyetr notebook as a Google Colab notebook. Create a Google drive folder named the `<Student_ID>_python_packaging` (e.g., `B05202021_python_packaging `), and put your packaging folder along with the Colab notebook under this folder. **Add brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com as an Editor of your entire `<Student_ID>_python_packaging` folder (we must be added, otherwise your email will fail to be uploaded to our Google Drive system)**, then get the link to your folder. An example is at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rTj921jBjsYaKSBkBpl9S5u5m9u1J6Ff?usp=share_link).
- Send an email with the subject title `[BHSTW] <Your_Student_ID> Python packaging` (e.g., `[BHSTW] B05202021 Python packaging`) to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com, where the student ID should have all English letters capitalized, and the module name should be precisely the same as the example, with only the first letter of the first word capitalized. The link to your Google Drive folder should be pasted in the email body.
- You will receive an email reply titled `Receipt of submission` about 30 minutes after your submission email has been sent. This email will notify you whether your files have been successfully uploaded.
- Please contact `Amanda Lin #5919` or `鐵觀音烤奶珍芋各半 #2410` on Discord if your submission email keeps failing.

## Grading:

- **Please note that the complexity of your module will be taken into account!!!** We sincerely hope that you're not sending us a toy module, and you probably wouldn't want to do that either as it'd hurt your grade — ouch ><
- Your assignment will be graded on a six-point scale: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, based on the complexibility/workability/executability of your module.
- We'll contact you if we have questions/are unclear about your module or execution code.
