# Functional parcellations in fMRI - Exercise

## Description:

-	This exercise is a copy from [Brainkhack School](https://school.brainhackmtl.org/modules/fmri_parcellation/), but have small adaptation and change the recipient.
-	This exercise seems unrelated to the video clip in this module, but idea of fMRI Parcellation application is the same. "The objectives of this module are to: 
	1. Understand the basis of the signal used in functional magnetic resonance imaging. 
	2. Know the main steps of preprocessing fMRI data. 
	3. Know how functional connectivity is calculated, and how it is most commonly used. 
	4. Know the main brain parcellations and associated technical challenges ."
-	Follow the steps in submission and hand in your assignment to TA.

## Instructions:

-	Watch the video and download [the notebook](https://github.com/BrainhackMTL/psy6983_2021/blob/master/content/en/modules/fmri_parcellation/atlas_parcellations.ipynb).
-	Please follow the tutorial and run the code in a Colab notebook or Jupyter notebook file.


## Submission:

- You should write your answer and execute the outcome as a Colab notebook or Jupyter notebook file.
- Mail your files to brainhackschooltaiwan@gmail.com or direct message to @dingruey88 on Discord. Please also include [BHSTW], your school number, and module name in the mail subject, such as `[BHSTW] B12202321 Functional parcellations in fMRI`.
