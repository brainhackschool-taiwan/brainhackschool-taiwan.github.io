From 2012 to 2020, I worked at Mind Research and Imaging Center (MRI center) at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU). During this period, I conducted many brain imaging studies and published several papers/posters in conferences regarding multi-model approaches, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting-state fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Also, I successfully organized some mini-workshops on fMRI studies introducing experiment designs and data analyses. On the national level, I have represented the MRI center to publish research findings in international annual meetings several times. I have always been self-motivated, resourceful and willing to motivate group members. Currently, I am in my third year of PhD at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience (ICN), National Central University (NCU). In the first year, my team and I were dedicated to understanding the neural mechanisms of motor control and attentional orienting by using a grip force transducer and electroencephalography (EEG). In the 2nd year, I incorporated noninvasive brain stimulation such as oscillation transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) into my research focused on predicting phosphene-perception. In order to stimulate the brain area more accurately on different individuals, I aim to learn about the brainsight neuronavigation system, which requires some knowledge in MRI and head modeling, for the next year. My long-term goal is to combine otDCS/ tACS, EEG, fMRI and MRS for researching conscious studies.

Hi! I am Jess Chih-Chia Hsing (芝嘉, she/her). I am currently working as a research assistant at the Brain Maid Lab, led by Dr. Josh Goh.

My work is related to utilizing Information-Theoretic approaches to characterize functional connectivity in the brain. Most of my work is done using *MATLAB* and *SPM*, but I also have some experience with *Python* and *GitHub*. I indulge myself in the Apple ecosystem; all of the devices I work with are from Apple, though I've also worked with Linux-based devices since the servers at our lab are Linux (CentOS and Ubuntu).

I shall be most helpful if you are planning to work with *MATLAB on fMRI-related projects*. But I am also open to helping people with other projects. (I used to work with EEG and MEG years ago.) Just like you, there are still tons of things I'm learning about neuroscience. With the engineering-based training I've received, I believe that we can solve problems together!

You can also learn more about me [here](http://gibms.mc.ntu.edu.tw/bmlab/people/chih-chia-hsing/). Happy Brainhacking!

I am Yun-Han Hsu, a master student in Graduate Institute of Linguistics, NTU. I am broadly interested in speech perception and psycholinguistics. Using ERP methods, my current project focuses on the perception of onset sibilant variants in Taiwan Mandarin. We investigate how different degrees of variant frequency influence the processing of pronunciation variants.

For my experience in data analysis, I primarily analyze my experimental EEG/ERP data via Matlab EEGLAB/ERPLAB. For statistical analysis and data visualization I usually use R. I also have some Python experience in data wriggling.
